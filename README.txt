Orléans Math Science - Static site (zero-build)
----------------------------------------------

This folder contains a single-file static website (index.html) using TailwindCSS CDN.
It is ready to be uploaded directly to Netlify Drop (no build, no account required) or
dragged to Vercel's upload or imported to a GitHub repo for Vercel deployment.

Simple deployment options (choose one):

A) Netlify Drop (fastest, no account)
   1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   2. Drag & drop this entire folder (or the index.html file).
   3. Netlify will host it instantly and give you a URL.
   4. Optional: create a free Netlify account to manage the site and add custom domain.

B) Vercel via GitHub (recommended if you want versioning & easy future updates)
   1. Create a GitHub account (if not already) and a new repository (e.g., orleans-math-science).
   2. Upload the content of this folder (index.html) to the repo using GitHub web upload.
   3. Go to https://vercel.com -> New Project -> Import Git Repository -> choose your repo.
   4. Vercel will detect a static site. Use default settings and Deploy.
   5. Add your custom domain in Vercel settings if desired.

C) Vercel Upload (if supported in your account)
   1. On Vercel, choose New Project -> Import -> Upload a ZIP or Folder (if shown).
   2. Upload this folder directly and deploy.

Local preview:
   - Open index.html in your browser (double-click) to preview locally.

If you want a full React + Vite project (editable with VS Code and build step), ask me and I will prepare a zip for that.
